In a coffee mug, place 1 teaspoon of unsweetened powdered cocoa, then cover a teaspoon with honey and drizzle it into the cup. Stir while the coffee brews, this is the fun part.

Pour hot espresso over the honey, stirring to dissolve. Serve with cream.", "strIBA": null, "strAlcoholic": "Non alcoholic"}
